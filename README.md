# esp-homekit-sonoff-mini

Homekit firmware for Sonoff mini

You can wire a switch across S1 & S2, this is NOT 240V, it is only ESP8265 signal level and does not require a paticularly heavy gauge of wire. 

Tested in UK dry linning wall box, tight fit but works ok. 


12th April 2022 - New capability added to preserve the power state over a power outage. By default the state will not be preserved, if you want to change the default to preserve the state then using Eve app set "Preserve State" to "On".
